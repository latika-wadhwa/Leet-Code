Question: 

Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

Solution:

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT  
        MAX(Salary) SecondHighestSalary 
FROM 
        Employee 
WHERE 
        ID In 
                (Select 
                        IIF(id = '', null, ID)
                        From 
                            Employee  
                        WHERE 
                            Salary != 
                                    (SELECT 
                                        MAX(salary) 
                                     FROM 
                                        Employee) GROUP BY Id)

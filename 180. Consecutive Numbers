Write a SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

+----+-----+
| Id | Num |
+----+-----+
| 1  |  1  |
| 2  |  1  |
| 3  |  1  |
| 4  |  2  |
| 5  |  1  |
| 6  |  2  |
| 7  |  2  |

For example, given the above Logs table, 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.

+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+

Solution:

Select 
    Distinct Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs a
WHERE
   Num = (Select num from Logs where id = (a.id+1) ) 
   AND 
   NUM = (Select num from Logs where id = (a.id+2) )

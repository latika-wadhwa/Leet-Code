Question: 
Suppose that a website contains two tables, the Customers table and the Orders table. Write a SQL query to find all customers who never order anything.

Table: Customers.

+----+-------+
| Id | Name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Table: Orders.

+----+------------+
| Id | CustomerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Using the above tables as example, return the following:

+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+

Solution: 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

/* LEFT JOIN ARE Better for Optimization over subqueries */
SELECT 
        Customers.Name As Customers
FROM
        Customers
LEFT JOIN 
        Orders
    ON Customers.Id = Orders.CustomerID

WHERE 
        Orders.Id IS NULL
